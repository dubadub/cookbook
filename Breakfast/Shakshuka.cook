Heat the @oil{1%tbsp} in a #frying pan{} that has a lid, then soften @red onions{2}, @garlic{1%clove} and @coriander{bunch%small} stalks for 5 mins until soft. Stir in the @tin tomatoes{1} and @caster sugar{1%tsp}, add @cumin ground{} then bubble for 8-10 mins until thick. Can be frozen for 1 month.

Using the back of a large spoon, make 4 dips in the sauce, then crack an @egg{4} into each one. Put a lid on the pan, then cook over a low heat for 6-8 mins, until the eggs are done to your liking. Scatter with the coriander leaves and serve with crusty bread.

Peel and de-vein the @raw shell-on king prawns{20-24}, reserving the heads and shells. Return the prawns to the fridge.

To make the stock, heat @olive oil{1%tbsp} in a #large pan{} over a medium-high heat and add the @onion{1}, @chopped tomatoes{1/2x400g%can}, @garlic cloves{6}, and reserved prawn shells and heads. Cook for 3-4 mins, then pour in @water{2%litres} and add the @chicken stock cube{1} and @star anise{1}. Bring to a boil, then simmer for ~stock{30%minutes}. Leave to cool slightly, then whizz in batches in a blender or food processor. Strain through a fine sieve.

Heat @olive oil{2%tbsp} in a #large paella pan{} or an extra-large frying pan{}. Brown the @monkfish{500g}(cut into chunks) for a few mins each side, then remove and set aside. Add @large onion, finely chopped{1} and fry for 4-5 mins until softened.

Stir in the @paella rice{500g} and cook for ~{30%seconds} to toast. Add the @garlic cloves, sliced{4}, @smoked paprika{2%tsp}, @cayenne pepper{1%tsp}(optional) and @saffron{1%pinch}, cook for another ~{30%seconds}, then stir in @chopped tomatoes{1/2%400g can} and 1.5 litres of the fish stock. Bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook, stirring, for ~{10%minutes} (the rice should still be al dente). Return the monkfish to the pan with the prawns, @mussels{500g}(cleaned), @frozen peas{100g} and @frozen baby broad beans{100g}.

Cover the pan with #foil{}, and cook on a low heat for another ~{10-15%minutes} until the mussels are open and the prawns are cooked through. Scatter over the @parsley leaves{handful}(roughly chopped) before serving.

Add the @flour{650%g} and @salt{1%tsp} to the #mixing bowl{}. Mix on low speed for 10 seconds to combine.

In a separate #bowl{}, whisk the @egg{1%large}. Add into the flour mix. Also add @oil{3%tbsp}.

Gradually pour @water{250%ml}(warm) into the stand mixer bowl while the mixer is running on low speed.

Once the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium-low. Knead for 6–8 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky but not sticky.

If the dough is too sticky, add a tablespoon of flour at a time. If it’s too dry, add a teaspoon of water.

Remove the dough from the mixer, shape it into a ball, and wrap it in plastic wrap or place it in a bowl covered with a damp cloth.

Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30–60 minutes. This relaxes the gluten and makes it easier to roll out.

Peel @potatoes{4%medium} and dice them into 1 cm cubes (we used the Vidalia Chopper). Place diced potatoes in a medium pot and cover with water. Add @vinegar{1%tbsp} and bring to a boil then continue boiling for 10 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked, but not falling apart. Drain well and set aside to cool. For quicker cooling, you can rinse potatoes with cold water. (This cooking method is thanks to one of my readers - Nadia).

While potatoes are cooking, boil @eggs{3} and cool them in ice water.

Next, dice eggs, @cucumbers{3}, @ham{250%g}. Also chop @dill{3%tbsp} and @green onions{1/2%cup}. Place everything in a large pot.

In a separate large bowl, whisk together @cold water{8%cups}, @sour cream{1/3%cup}, @vinegar{2.5%tbsp}, @salt{2.5%tsp} until combined. Pour the mixture in the pot with the rest of ingredients. Stir to combine and serve.

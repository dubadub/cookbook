we're family of 3 (m40, f41 and 6 months old daughter as of 24/10/2025). we have russian background, but living in Ireland now. we eat everything. we prefer not to eat carbs for dinner and make dinner light. we like 3 days schedule for meal planning. with a baby we prefer dishes that easy to cook (like slowcooker) and that can be eaten for more than once. 

we started first stage of weaning. we aim to give a new mono food every 3 days. we also give perviously given food as second meal during the day. So far we gave seet potato, broccoli, carrots, apple, chicken, beef, yogurt.

Set your #slow cooker{} to low. Tip in the @onion{1}, @celery sticks{2}, @carrots{2} and @leeks{2} and nestle @bay leaf{1} and @thyme sprigs{3}. Sit the @chicken{1%whole medium} on top of the veg and pour over the @chicken stock{2%l}. Cook for 6-8 hours.


Remove the chicken from the slow cooker and transfer to a board. Shred the meat from the bones using two forks, then return the meat to the slow cooker, discarding the bones. Season to taste and stir through the @lemon{1} juice.


Remove and discard the bunch of herbs. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with the @dill or @parsley. Serve with crusty bread, if you like.

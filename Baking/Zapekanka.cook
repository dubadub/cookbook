Preheat oven to 180C. Brush your baking pan with melted/softened @butter{} (or spray with oil) and sprinkle with @flour.

In a #large bowl{}, whisk together the @eggs{5%medium}, @sugar{¾%cup}, @milk{½%milk}, @flour{½%cup}, @vanilla extract{2%tsp}, and @sea salt{¼%tsp} (all the ingredients except for the farmer's cheese and raisins).

Stir in the @farmer's cheese{900%g} and mix really well to combine and make sure there are no farmer's cheese clumps remaining.

Pour the batter into the prepared #pan and bake at 180C for ~{40-60%minutes}, or until the center is set and forms a thin crust (no batter stuck to the spoon when gently touched). The cheesecake will puff up and the edges will be golden brown. The baking time will depend on the size and shape of your pan, start checking on the cake after 40 minutes.

Allow to cool to room temperature before sprinkling with powdered sugar or slicing. Serve at room temperature or chilled with berry sauce, whipped cream, or ice cream.

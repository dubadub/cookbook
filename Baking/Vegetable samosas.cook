Set a #large pan{} of salted water to boil.

Peel and chop @potatoes{400%g} into rough 2.5cm chunks, then break the @cauliflower{250%g} into florets so they’re roughly the same size.

Add the potatoes to boiling water and cook for ~{12%minutes}, or until tender, adding the cauliflower after 3 minutes. Add the @frozen peas{125%g} for the final minute, then drain.

Peel and finely chop the @onion{1} and @garlic{2%cloves}, then peel and finely grate the @ginger{5%cm}.

Drizzle a lug of @oil into a #large non-stick frying pan{} over a medium heat, add the @cumin seeds{1%tsp} and onion and cook for ~{8%minutes}, or until softened but not coloured. Stir in the garlic and ginger, then fry for a further few minutes.

Bash the @fennel seeds{1/2%tsp} to a fine powder and add to the pan along with the @garam masala{1%tsp} and @ground coriander{1%tsp}. Stir well.

Stir the cooked veg into the pan and crush gently with a potato masher – don't overdo it: you want a fairly chunky mixture. Squeeze in the @lemon{1/2} juice and season to taste. Leave to cool, then pick, finely chop and stir in the @coriander leaves{1/2%bunch}.

Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Lightly grease a large baking tray with @oil.

On a flour-dusted surface, halve the dough and roll out each portion to about 3cm thick. Using a 7cm pastry cutter, stamp out as many circles as you can, then roll into rounds, roughly ½cm thick and 18cm in diameter.

Cut each round in half, then brush the straight edges with a little water. Roll into a cone shape, bringing the straight edges together and pressing lightly to seal.

Spoon in the filling, brush the exposed dough with a little water, then fold over and press to seal. Place onto the prepared baking tray, then repeat with the remaining ingredients, keeping the samosas covered with a damp tea towel as you go.

Brush the samosas with a little oil and bake for ~{45%minutes}, or until golden and piping hot through. Serve straightaway with mango chutney.

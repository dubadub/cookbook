Combine the @flour{250%g} and @baking soda{1%teaspoon}.

In a separate #bowl, whisk the @eggs{4} with @sugar{300%g} using a #mixer{} until you get a smooth, light, creamy mixture.

Add the @sour cream{200%g} to the eggs, whisk again, then pour in the melted @butter{100%g} and mix once more.

Gradually add the flour and whisk thoroughly.

Divide the dough into two parts.

To one part, add the @cocoa powder{2%tbsp} and mix until smooth.

Line the bottom of a #baking pan{} with parchment paper and grease the bottom and sides with @butter.

Place 2 tablespoons of the light dough in the center.

Then, pour the same amount of the chocolate mixture over it.

Continue layering the dough until it's all used up.

You can create a beautiful pattern on the cake. To do this, use a #wooden stick{} to draw lines from the edge of the pan to the center at different places.

Place the pan in a preheated #oven{} at 180°C for about ~{40%minutes}.

Check readiness with a toothpick—it should come out dry when inserted into the center of the cake.
